OTG todo:
+ Make dimension teleportation to any dimension work.
+ Bonus Chests do not spawn with radius spawn
+ Test all presets enmasse with the biomebits update (and possibly find a way to make biomegroupsbit smaller whilst adding a bit to biomebits
+ WriteWithoutComments does not work any more, perhaps due to the biomebits update?
+ Servers require naming the world DregoraRL (Should just default to dregora regardless of name)
+ Fix Issue with SpongeForge deleting chunks of villages and such on multiplayer only (not singleplayer)

+ Remove 90% (GARDENS) Ruins and recurrent structures from Trench / Trench border
+ Structures generating in air Recurrent in Dregora_FrozenMudMountainSlope including villages

+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows (no withers anymore, ghouls now)
