Postponed due to OTG:

+ Remove 90% (GARDENS) Ruins and recurrent structures from Trench / Trench border
+ Structures generating in air Recurrent in Dregora_FrozenMudMountainSlope including villages
+ add lightning spawns to center (using lycanite?) to create a atmosphere - activate in a radius every x ticks & activate on pressure plate at random spot
+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows (no withers anymore, ghouls now)
+ weird color blending is half(ish) intended, most is murky, the rest is default color for compatibility reasons with ocean stuff. Can improve this a bit down the line)
+ too many pixies in general biomes, (This is per default?)
+ Infernal mob in viking village always same type (non-issue)
