Dregora todo:


OTG todo:
+ Make dimension teleportation to any dimension work.
+ Bonus Chests do not spawn with radius spawn
+ Test all presets enmasse with the biomebits update (and possibly find a way to make biomegroupsbit smaller whilst adding a bit to biomebits
+ WriteWithoutComments does not work any more, perhaps due to the biomebits update?
+ Servers require naming the world DregoraRL (Should just default to dregora regardless of name)
+ Fix Issue with SpongeForge deleting chunks of villages and such on multiplayer only (not singleplayer)

Removed from ToDo for various reasons, may be revisited later.
+ Add cliff boulder idea to ocean islands
+ add silverfish rocks & ores (Yeah, people just wont ever go underground any more if I did this) < So lets only add them above ground HUEHUEHUE
+ Redo underground dragon bones, add gold n such.
+ BOP adds one entity (the wasp, spawns in nether & in steppe biomes in wasp nests attached to skyscrapers)
+ Remove 90% (GARDENS) Ruins and recurrent structures from Trench / Trench border
+ Structures generating in air Recurrent in Dregora_FrozenMudMountainSlope including villages
+ add lightning spawns to center (using lycanite?) to create a atmosphere - activate in a radius every x ticks & activate on pressure plate at random spot
+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows (no withers anymore, ghouls now)
+ weird color blending is half(ish) intended, most is murky, the rest is default color for compatibility reasons with ocean stuff. Can improve this a bit down the line)
+ too many pixies in general biomes, (This is per default?)
+ Infernal mob in viking village always same type (non-issue)
+ Dregora_LushMesaCompat DLD spawn issue

Future Todo:

+ Creeper spawner trap fast spawning
+ Ornamental pillars with loot in center
+ check if possible suggestion: in newer versions of ice and fire, those horse fish things can be tamed with kelp; if you can change that in configs, make bop kelp work
+ make boobytrap cave sections and generate them everywhere
+ Add Waystone custom structure to Villages / Outposts (Trader_Silo missing)

+ Take a look at enchantments and the current enchantment meta to switch things up a bit
+ add a few more quality tiers (people seem to like skill issue so why not) (custom items with very low qt weight? > would make looted weapons kinda cool > also rng so Gambling :D
+ more custom items and actual documentation for them >(Custom Item weapons are broken sometimes (They Revert to pre spartanfire changes) Wrong damage values, attack speed etc.)
+ more mobs for custom dungeons... AND actual documentation for them (blighted custom mobs?)
+ Add funny but rare arrow of return trap at the end of a dungeon. (Buh-BYE!)
+ Look at foodfunk, if we're not able to get it working no sweat. If we can awesome (Low tier foods would finally be usefull again. Looking at you cooked egg)
+ XzeroAir: Find Broken Gun parts, Collect them all, Restore them, craft it into a new gun, and when you use it, It just explodes in your face killing you > XzeroAir: When the Gun Explodes and kills you, it should give you an Quest, "I should have taken lessons"
