OTG todo:
+ Make dimension teleportation to any dimension work.
+ Bonus Chests do not spawn with radius spawn
+ Test all presets enmasse with the biomebits update (and possibly find a way to make biomegroupsbit smaller whilst adding a bit to biomebits
+ WriteWithoutComments does not work any more, perhaps due to the biomebits update?
+ Servers require naming the world DregoraRL (Should just default to dregora regardless of name)
+ Fix Issue with SpongeForge deleting chunks of villages and such on multiplayer only (not singleplayer)

Removed from ToDo for various reasons, may be revisited later.
+ Add cliff boulder idea to ocean islands
+ add silverfish rocks & ores (Yeah, people just wont ever go underground any more if I did this)
+ Redo underground dragon bones, add gold n such.
+ BOP adds one entity (the wasp, spawns in nether & in steppe biomes in wasp nests attached to skyscrapers)
+ Remove 90% (GARDENS) Ruins and recurrent structures from Trench / Trench border
+ Structures generating in air Recurrent in Dregora_FrozenMudMountainSlope including villages
+ add lightning spawns to center (using lycanite?) to create a atmosphere - activate in a radius every x ticks & activate on pressure plate at random spot
+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows (no withers anymore, ghouls now)
+ weird color blending is half(ish) intended, most is murky, the rest is default color for compatibility reasons with ocean stuff. Can improve this a bit down the line)
+ too many pixies in general biomes, (This is per default?)
+ Infernal mob in viking village always same type (non-issue)
+ Dregora_LushMesaCompat DLD spawn issue
+ Fix floating flesh blocks in water Atomic city / Desert City Creek biome
+ Preferably remove ravines in trench (lava flow bugs)
+ add recipes (bop gems) to swords
+ decrease amount of chests in corrupted graves
+ Defiled Lands Biome remove pixie villages replace with Vex Villages

Future Todo:
+ swap underneath modern buildings for industrial infrastructure

+ Add Weather mod to the LC dimension
+ make days longer using a mod that adds ticks to days (not freeze time)

+ Observers (beholders?) wont spawn in Dregora?
+ Colin lore change & expansion
+ Boss xEmtek

+ Creeper spawner trap fast spawning
