Fixed/Changed/Added:


Dregora To Do:
+ swamp trader zombie needs water block not air
+ fix heaven encounters too op in some cases
+ add flying brigade to each biomegroup type
+ bop berry bush in Orchard

RLCraft TO Do:
+ test lycanite events

Postponed due to OTG:
+ Servers require naming the world DregoraRL (Should just default to dregora regardless of name)

Removed from ToDo for various reasons, may be revisited later.
+ BOP adds one entity (the wasp, spawns in nether & in steppe biomes in wasp nests attached to skyscrapers)
+ Remove 90% (GARDENS) Ruins and recurrent structures from Trench / Trench border
+ Structures generating in air Recurrent in Dregora_FrozenMudMountainSlope including villages
+ add lightning spawns to center (using lycanite?) to create a atmosphere - activate in a radius every x ticks & activate on pressure plate at random spot
+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows (no withers anymore, ghouls now)
+ weird color blending is half(ish) intended, most is murky, the rest is default color for compatibility reasons with ocean stuff. Can improve this a bit down the line)
+ too many pixies in general biomes, (This is per default?)
+ Infernal mob in viking village always same type (non-issue)
+ Dregora_LushMesaCompat DLD spawn issue
+ Fix floating flesh blocks in water Atomic city / Desert City Creek biome
