- extend day from 10 to 20 minutes (Already Set?) - increased to 25 minutes.
- add bop and dynamic trees bop blocks to goblin climbable blocks
- make sure skill requirements are correct (example: saplings) 
- made kelp drop aquaculture:food:0 & made aquaculture:food:0 cookable -> kelp & made kelp a fuel source

- lower bamboo burn time to 200 ticks & added dead leaves as fuel for 100 ticks.

#TODO LIST ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dregora:
+ add villagers (gem traders)
+ test if ice and fire mobs and stonelings (and probably other mobs) spawn in bop and dragora biomes
+ nerf sleeper sword to be worse then dragon sword & decrease durability to 1 (also put more enchantments on it so it cant be enchanted further)
+ test multiplayer spawns
+ rubberbanding issues, seemingly somewhere in forests, keep an eye out for this issue using /tps
+ add biomesoplenty:gem to fromimage biomes
+ remove bop bushes & replace for rustic ones
+ fix random encounters
+ weird color blending is half(ish) intended, most is murky, the rest is default color for compatibility reasons with ocean stuff. Can improve this a bit down the line)

RLCraft:
+ check if possible suggestion: in newer versions of ice and fire, those horse fish things can be tamed with kelp; if you can change that in configs, make bop kelp work
+ add lightning spawns to center (using lycanite?) to create a atmosphere - activate in a radius every x ticks & activate on pressure plate at random spot
+ exclusion zone around 0,0 (colission issues)
+ add recipes (bop gems) to swords
+ replace some wither skeleton with swords for wither skeletons with bows
+ remove recipes added by bop (the ones that don't need to exist) 
+ check for level up xp dupes with new recipes
+ look at bop issues page for bugs and dupes
+ check the end + nether, BOP alters these in some ways
+ BOP adds one entity (the wasp, spawns in nether & in steppe biomes in wasp nests attached to skyscrapers)
+ Servers require naming the world DregoraRL (Should just default to dregora regardless of name)
+ Still need to click through options to enable Dregora on world creation (Should be default/only option)
+ BoP poison/lycanite poison looks the same (unless we figured out that BoP poison doesnt spawn/doesnt exist)
+ check that increased day time doesnt cause bugs
+ Bop shouldn't spawn with dregora, think I also removed bop poison from bop configs. Also disable bucket click on bop with craft tweaker should be easy, added that to list
+ Infernal mob in viking village always same type (likely a quirk that rarely happens and isn't really a big issue)
